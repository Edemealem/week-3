# Week 3 Project Challenge Overview
This project consists of Jupyter Notebooks and scripts designed to perform various data analysis tasks related to 
the Week 3 challenges.

## Completed Steps

1. **Task 1 - Git and GitHub**
- Created a Git repository with a README.
- Implemented version control and CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Data summarization and quality assessment.
- Univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Visualization of key insights.

2. **Task 2 - Data Version Control (DVC)**

- Installed and initialized DVC for data tracking.
- Set up local remote storage and added datasets.
- Committed changes and pushed data to local remote.

3. **Task 3 - A/B Hypothesis Testin**

- Tested null hypotheses regarding risk differences across provinces, zip codes, and demographics:
- Provinces: Fail to reject the null hypothesis; no significant risk differences across provinces.
- Zip Codes: Fail to reject the null hypothesis; no significant risk differences between zip codes.
- Profit Differences: Fail to reject the null hypothesis; no significant profit differences between groups.
- Gender: Fail to reject the null hypothesis; no significant risk differences between Women and Men.
- Conducted statistical tests (chi-squared, t-tests) to analyze data.
- Documented findings and their business implications.
4. **Task 4 - Statistical Modeling**

- Prepared data by handling missing values and engineering new features.
- Encoded categorical data and split into training and test sets.
- Built and evaluated models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Analyzed feature importance using SHAP for interpretability.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into data-driven decision-making, helping organizations understand customer behavior and improve their services.
